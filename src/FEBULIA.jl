# FEBULIA.jl --
#
# FEBULIA.jl is the Julia implementation of the Finite Elements Basis 
# 1D basis include: piecewise linear, quadratic (symmetric and non-symmetric),
# Lagrange and exponential, with their derivatives. The basis object is associated
# to boundary conditions, such as Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin types.
# The 2D basis object only supports piecewise linear function (so far).
# Some examples of discretized operator are implemented, e.g. Laplace and advection
# operators in cylindrical and cartesian coordinates
